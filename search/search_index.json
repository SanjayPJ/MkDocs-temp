There is no option to override this behavior. GETTING THE GIST OF MARKDOWN\u2019S FORMATTING SYNTAX This page offers a brief overview of what it\u2019s like to use Markdown. The syntax page provides complete, detailed documentation for every feature, but Markdown should be very easy to pick up simply by looking at a few examples of it in action. The examples on this page are written in a before/after style, showing example syntax and the HTML output produced by Markdown. It\u2019s also helpful to simply try Markdown out; the Dingus is a web application that allows you type your own Markdown-formatted text and translate it to XHTML. NOTE: This document is itself written using Markdown; you can see the source for it by adding \u2018.text\u2019 to the URL. PARAGRAPHS, HEADERS, BLOCKQUOTES A paragraph is simply one or more consecutive lines of text, separated by one or more blank lines. (A blank line is any line that looks like a blank line\u2009\u2014\u2009a line containing nothing but spaces or tabs is considered blank.) Normal paragraphs should not be indented with spaces or tabs. Markdown offers two styles of headers: Setext and atx. Setext-style headers for and are created by \u201cunderlining\u201d with equal signs (=) and hyphens (-), respectively. To create an atx-style header, you put 1-6 hash marks (#) at the beginning of the line\u2009\u2014\u2009the number of hashes equals the resulting HTML header level. Blockquotes are indicated using email-style \u2018>\u2019 angle brackets. Markdown: A First Level Header A Second Level Header A first level header Now is the time for all good men to come to the aid of their country. This is just a regular paragraph. The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog's back. Header 3 This is a blockquote. This is the second paragraph in the blockquote. This is an H2 in a blockquote Output: A First Level Header A Second Level Header Now is the time for all good men to come to the aid of their country. This is just a regular paragraph. The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog's back. Header 3 This is a blockquote. This is the second paragraph in the blockquote. This is an H2 in a blockquote PHRASE EMPHASIS Markdown uses asterisks and underscores to indicate spans of emphasis. Markdown: Some of these words are emphasized . Some of these words are emphasized also . Use two asterisks for strong emphasis . Or, if you prefer, use two underscores instead . Output: Some of these words are emphasized . Some of these words are emphasized also . Use two asterisks for strong emphasis . Or, if you prefer, use two underscores instead . LISTS Unordered (bulleted) lists use asterisks, pluses, and hyphens (*, +, and -) as list markers. These three markers are interchangable; this: Candy. Gum. Booze. this: Candy. Gum. Booze. and this: Candy. Gum. Booze. all produce the same output: Candy. Gum. Booze. Ordered (numbered) lists use regular numbers, followed by periods, as list markers: Red Green Blue Output: Red Green Blue If you put blank lines between items, you\u2019ll get tags for the list item text. You can create multi-paragraph list items by indenting the paragraphs by 4 spaces or 1 tab: A list item. With multiple paragraphs. Another item in the list. Output: A list item. With multiple paragraphs. Another item in the list. LINKS Markdown supports two styles for creating links: inline and reference. With both styles, you use square brackets to delimit the text you want to turn into a link. Inline-style links use parentheses immediately after the link text. For example: This is an example link . Output: This is an example link . Optionally, you may include a title attribute in the parentheses: This is an example link . Output: This is an example link . Reference-style links allow you to refer to your links by names, which you define elsewhere in your document: I get 10 times more traffic from Google than from Yahoo or MSN . Output: I get 10 times more traffic from Google than from Yahoo or MSN . The title attribute is optional. Link names may contain letters, numbers and spaces, but are not case sensitive: I start my morning with a cup of coffee and The New York Times .","title":"About writing notes"},{"location":"about/#about-writing-notes","text":"Files and directories with names which begin with a dot (for example: .foo.md or .bar/baz.md ) are ignored by MkDocs, which matches the behavior of most web servers.
